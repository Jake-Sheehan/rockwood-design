            <h2>Phillip Baker</h2>
            <p>
                Phillip graduated (2011) from Wentworth Institute of Technology
                with his Masters in Architecture. His love for design and
                drawing began at a young age where he always had the dream of
                studying architecture and design homes. With the push of family
                and friends, Phillip was able to pursue a career in
                Architectural Design and learn all aspects, small and large,
                from landscape, residential, and to commercial. Combining the
                knowledge received in school and the experience gained from
                working in the field, Phillip is able to create timeless designs
                that seamlessly blend in with the existing building fabric.
